The 1970s is also often described by scholars as a decade in which there was a renaissance of African American women’s writing as well as the publication of several experimental African American literary works. In this seminar, we will study this lively period in African American literary history primarily through novels, some of them recently republished or adapted into other forms. What idea of African American literature do we get when we read novels from this era? What questions were asked in 1970s African American novels that we continue to ask now? Novels we will likely read include detective fiction, diaristic fiction, satirical fiction, a love story, and historical fiction.",

    "text": "Race and Migration in the diaspora: Latin America and the Caribbean This seminar focuses on a critical and often neglected dimension of the Black experience in Latin American and the Caribbean. It introduces students to a particular aspect of the field of Africana studies, that takes account of the particular historical experiences and critical theoretical perspectives that shape the social construction and functioning of race in the region. It introduces students to some of the key thinkers around race in Latin America, the Caribbean and the US, to better understand how ideas of race cross boundaries and intersect to generate specific racial hierarchies. It pays particular attention to how ideas around race respond to broader global forces. It uses migration within Latin America and the Caribbean as a concrete instance for exploring historic and contemporary manifestation of anti-Black racism, and as sites for community building and resistance.

Through lecture and hands-on laboratories, students will learn the complete anatomy of the human skeleton, with an emphasis on the human skeleton in functional and evolutionary perspective. We will also explore forensic and bioarchaeological approaches to the skeleton. By the course's conclusion, students will be able to conduct basic skeletal analysis and will be prepared for more advanced studies of the skeleton from medical, forensic, archaeological, and evolutionary perspectives.

    "description": "Aging is a fundamental biological process. It is the major risk factor for age-related diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, stroke, osteoporosis, arthritis and Alzheimer's, just to name a few. As life expectancy has increased in the 20th century, these diseases have become the leading causes of death. Recent research has identified universal mechanisms that regulate organismal aging and impact all organ systems. Several gene networks that can regulate the rate of aging and multiple age-related diseases have already been discovered. These mechanisms are conserved throughout evolution and many key insights have been garnered from simple model organisms. Manipulation of these networks has been achieved by diet, genetic engineering, and most recently, with drugs. The goal of modern medicine is to increase healthy survival, as opposed to simply longevity. It is now generally acknowledged that increasing health span – the fraction of our life spans free of frailty and debilitating chronic disease – has become a realistic goal. This course will examine the new concept of &quot;geroscience&quot; – the molecular, cellular, and genetic foundations of the biology of aging, and how this knowledge can be applied to therapies for age-associated diseases. Course material will be based on the primary research literature. Prerequisites are a background in cell biology, molecular biology and genetics - such as BIOL0470, BIOL0280, BIOL0200, and BIOL0800.",

This interdisciplinary course offers a fresh perspective, placing emphasis on cultural exploration and underscoring chemistry's profound influence on artistic expressions throughout history. Topics encompass the utilization of color in art, chemical analysis of pigments, art conservation, ceramics, pottery, stained glass, and more. The course content will revolve around cultivating engaging discussions through a series of case studies, providing students with opportunities to engage in hands-on activities and complete insightful writing assignments. By the end of the course, students will have acquired a deep-seated understanding of how chemistry has shaped human creativity, cultural identity, and artistic expression. Chemistry"

We will consider a variety of visual representations, architectural monuments, and urban centers to investigate the types of places, natural phenomena, and individuals that were considered sacred. The class also explores how the art and architecture of temples and sanctuaries informs the nature of ancient ritual in a cross-cultural setting (A). History of Art and Architecture"

We explore topics including language policy (e.g., nation-building, linguistic purism and standardization, language maintenance and preservation), minority languages, relevance of inflectional grammar to discourse, metaphor, code-switching and diglossia, language contact, (im)politeness, and language origin-myths and their significance to the conceptualization of the politics of language. Case-studies on languages in East Europe, Russia are used as entry-points to classroom discussions. Knowledge of Slavic languages is not required. Open to advanced undergraduate and graduate students. First- and second-year students who demonstrate their knowledge of the basic notions in linguistics or their familiarity with Russia and East Europe may enroll with the instructor’s written permission. Enrollment limited to 20.",

AFRI0370,African American Novels of the 1970s,M. Ajibade,M 3-5:30p,,Africana Studies,"Literary historians generally agree that in the 1970s , in the U.S., there was a significant increase in the publication of diverse forms of African American literature. The 1970s is also often described by scholars as a decade in which there was a renaissance of African American women’s writing as well as the publication of several experimental African American literary works. In this seminar, we will study this lively period in African American literary history primarily through novels, some of them recently republished or adapted into other forms. What idea of African American literature do we get when we read novels from this era? What questions were asked in 1970s African American novels that we continue to ask now? Novels we will likely read include detective fiction, diaristic fiction, satirical fiction, a love story, and historical fiction.",CAB,"African American Novels of the 1970s Literary historians generally agree that in the 1970s , in the U.S., there was a significant increase in the publication of diverse forms of African American literature.

ANTH1215,The Anthropology of Aging,L. DiCarlo,M 3-5:30p,,Anthropology,"In a recent article entitled “Aging is the Real Population Bomb”, Bloom and Zucker describe a world that is being disrupted by the changing shape of the population pyramid. By 2050, it is estimated that one in six people worldwide will be over 65, up from just one in eleven in 2019. This shift is reshaping everything—from healthcare demands and pension systems to labor markets and technological innovation. In this course we will examine the experiences of growing old. We will explore what it means to grow old within societies, families, workplaces, and social networks. We will examine prevalent attitudes and stereotypes about age and aging that shape interpersonal and institutional practices. Through an examination of lived experiences, cultural beliefs, and social practices, we will develop a clear understanding of the experience of aging.",CAB,"The Anthropology of Aging In a recent article entitled “Aging is the Real Population Bomb”, Bloom and Zucker describe a world that is being disrupted by the changing shape of the population pyramid.

Lennon,M 3-5:30p,,Anthropology,"Environmental anthropology is rooted in a classic dialectical conundrum: in order to trouble the specious line between nature and culture, you need to take that line seriously. Ethnography is a powerful medium for navigating this conundrum; ethnographic monographs render nature as a legible category that emerges through humans' everyday lives, political systems, and cultural infrastructures. Ethnographic monographs position the environment as a conceptual genre for understanding nature/culture &quot;intra-actions.&quot; We will examine the writing conventions, theoretical paradigms, and qualitative data of full-length ethnographies on environmental conservation, forests, flooding, human/animal relations, energy, extractivism, soil, and waste, considering these texts as media for negotiating the nature/culture divide.

Primary readings for this course are in Arabic with secondary readings in English. At least three years of Arabic (or equivalent) are required for enrollment. Comparative Literature"
